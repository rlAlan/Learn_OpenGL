# Deep Thoughts

Our brains work similar to computers, we have jolts of electricity that pass through certain gates ending and ending up as some sort of 
data that we can use.

Unlike computers we are mostly unaware of what happens. When we form thoughts are we directly forcing the electricity to move, no.
We more or less urge another part of out brain to do this for us, whoes to say that this other part of out brain is us. It's not our
conscious mind thats doing it but somethign else; something unknown.

Take spontanous thoughs for example, when we need information it more or less pops up in our mind we didnt do anything to get it 
we just urged our minds to being it. Sort of like a Job were you are the boss overseeing the employees, you dont care how they get the job
done as long as they bring you the reports. Using this analogy whats to say that there are infact others inside you, to be specific 
others that arent you that maniulate the brain to give you what you want when you want.

when we are exposed to something long enough we start to form opinions we become biased towards/against that thing, essentially we are 
manipulated in some way towards/against that thing most of the time without realising; what if that same thing was happening to us.
What if our minds are being manipulated without us realising. If our minds are capable of maniplating the brain to give us what we want
when we want then surley its strong enough to make us do things we would never think of doing, right? Ill leave you to carry on this thought.

This is one of the many reasons as to why i dont belive in true free will. Until the day i am able to see past the layers of abstraction
my brain has placed on me i will never truly trust my decisions to be my own.

(Yes i know that this is dumb and my last statement doesnt truly make sense since if were able to gain access to the abstracted layers
i would definetly die but i thought about this on the spot so yeah.)

Thank you Germanes for this thought stuff.
Grammer and Spelling is bad so gg.
